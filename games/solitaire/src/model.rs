//! Klondike: the deal, the rules and scoring, undo, the save format, and the solver behind
//! "winnable deals only".
//!
//! # The solver
//!
//! A deal is winnable when some line of play wins it with every card known (the "thoughtful"
//! game). The solver decides that the way Blake and Gent's Solvitaire does ("The Winnability of
//! Klondike Solitaire and Many Other Patience Games", JAIR 2025, arXiv:1906.12314), the most
//! complete study of the question:
//!
//! - **The stock as a pool.** Rather than searching every turn of the stock, a move may play any
//!   stock card that some number of turns would bring to the top of the waste. Turning one card
//!   at a time with unlimited passes, that is every card in it.
//! - **Depth-first search with a transposition table.** A position already explored is never
//!   explored again. The key is canonical: the columns are sorted before hashing, because a
//!   position with its columns in another order plays the same.
//! - **The paper's two proven dominances.** A card goes home automatically when no card that
//!   could still need it is out (at most two ranks above both foundations of the other color and
//!   three above the other one of its own), and part of a built run moves only to free the card
//!   beneath it for its foundation.
//! - **No worrying back** a foundation card that the first dominance would send straight home.
//! - **A streamlined first pass** that always plays to the foundations when it can, which finds
//!   most wins far sooner; only when it fails does the complete search run.
//! - **Restarts.** Depth-first search is heavy-tailed: one early wrong turn can cost more
//!   positions than the whole budget. A few short complete passes, each with the move order
//!   lightly shuffled, find most of the remaining wins before the long, unshuffled pass.
//!
//! A win the solver finds is replayed through [`Model`]'s own rules before the deal counts as
//! winnable, so a solver bug could cost a deal but never deal an unwinnable one. With every card
//! known, about 90% of draw-one deals and 82% of draw-three deals can be won (Blake and Gent).
